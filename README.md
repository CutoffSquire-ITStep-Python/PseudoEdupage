# 🏫 School Management System

A lightweight Django-based web application for managing core school entities: teachers, students, classes, subjects, and grades.

---

## Models

| Model | Description |
|---|---|
| `Teacher` | Staff members with academic degree, contact info, and active status |
| `Student` | Enrolled students with optional date of birth and active status |
| `SchoolClass` | Classes numbered 1–9, each with a unique abbreviation and a list of enrolled students |
| `Subject` | School subjects linked to one teacher and many students |
| `Grade` | Grades (1–5) of types: classwork, homework, test, or project — linked to students and subjects |

## Forms

Each model has a corresponding `ModelForm` with:

- Bootstrap-compatible widgets (`form-control`, `form-check-input`)
- Client-friendly placeholders and help texts
- Server-side validation (unique email/name checks, age limits, grade range, phone digit count)

## Styles

A custom `styles.css` provides a warm card-based UI theme with:

- **Fonts**: Syne (headings) + Nunito (body)
- **Palette**: warm amber/orange gradients on a cream background
- **Effects**: pop-in animation, focus glow, hover lift on the submit button
- Fully responsive down to mobile (≤ 576 px)

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML + custom CSS (Bootstrap class hooks)
- **DB constraints**: `UniqueConstraint` and `CheckConstraint` at the model level for data integrity
